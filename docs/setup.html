<h1>Setting up RCHpr</h1>
<h3>You will need Git, node.js, electron and some kind of editor supporting .json files (notepad will do lol). I will link those later rn I cba lol</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you're on Mac/Linux, open <strong>Terminal</strong>. On Windows, go to
  the Start Menu, type in <code>cmd.exe</code> and press Enter.</li>
<li>Run <code>git clone https://github.com/ICTman1076/RCHpr.git</code>
  to download the repo</li>
<li>Run <code>cd RCHpr</code> to go to the folder</li>
<li>Run (Windows only) <code>copy config.json.example config.json</code> or
  (on macOS/Linux) <code>cp config.json.example config.json</code> to initialise
   the configuration</li>
<li>Run <code>npm install</code> to install all the requirements</li>
<li>Open a file browser - this could be Finder on Mac or Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Now, go to the folder where RCHpr was downloaded</li>
<li>Open <code>config.json</code> with your chosen .json editor</li>
<li>Many settings in config.json are very broken due to the new preset feature.
  To add presets, follow the examples given in the games array - <code>name</code>
  is what will be displayed, <code>code</code> (which must be all lower case) should
  be unique, and will also display the images you set up in the discord rich presence
  developer section, where the name is the same as <code>code</code>.
  <!--If you'd like different default text, change the values of the stuff inside
   <code>textConfig</code>. For example, changing <code>state</code> to "hi"
   will make "hi" be the text used by default on the start of SimplePresence.-->
 </li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT: At the bottom there is a "clientID". This is currently set
to a test id owned by me and so is unreliable. If you want your own, create a
rich presence app as shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHKbUTkjnxs">here</a>
and use the client ID generated from that.</strong> If you do create your own
you can upload your own images, instead of suffering with mine lol</li>
<li>Save <code>config.json</code> and close Atom</li>
<li>Make sure <strong>Discord</strong> is running (only one - you can't have
  more than one open!)</li>
<li>Go back to Cmd or Terminal, and run <code>npm start</code>
</li>
<li>You have successfully set up and started RCHpr!</li>
